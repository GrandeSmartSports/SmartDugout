# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

**Your Project Hub is Ready!**

---

## 📦 What You Got

Four synchronized documents that work across all your workspaces:

1. **PROJECT_HUB.md** - Your landing page (start here!)
2. **VISION.md** - Big picture strategy and goals
3. **TASKS.md** - What needs to be done and by whom
4. **DECISIONS.md** - Log of all important choices

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Step 1: Sync to Your Workspaces

**You now have 6 files:**
- PROJECT_HUB.md (main landing page)
- VISION.md (strategy and goals)
- TASKS.md (task tracking)
- DECISIONS.md (decision log)
- QUICK_START.md (this guide)
- DASHBOARD.html (visual dashboard - **open this in your browser!**)

**For GitHub (Dev):**
1. Download these files
2. Add them to your repo root
3. Commit with message: "Add project hub documentation"
4. Tell Dev: "Review the Project Hub, then [your request]"

**For Google Drive (Opi):**
1. Download these files  
2. Upload to your project folder in Drive
3. Tell Opi: "Review the Project Hub, then [your request]"

**For Claude Chat (Alex):**
✅ Already set up! Just reference the files in future conversations.

### Step 2: Fill in Your Vision
```
"Update VISION.md with: 
- Product name: [name]
- What we're building: [description]
- Target users: [audience]"
```

### Step 3: Add Your First Tasks
```
"Update TASKS.md with high priority task: 
[Task description] assigned to [Claude Code/Cowork/Claude Chat]"
```

## 💬 How to Talk to Each Claude (Super Simple)

### Starting Any Session
```
"Review the Project Hub, then [what you want done]"
```

### Ending Any Session  
```
"Update our Project Hub with what we discussed"
```

**That's it!** Each Claude handles:
- Reading all relevant docs
- Understanding current context
- Documenting what happened
- Keeping everything synced

### Examples:

**With Alex (Claude Chat):**
```
"Review the Project Hub, then help me plan our MVP features"
[conversation happens]
"Update the board"
```

**With Dev (Claude Code):**
```
"Review the Project Hub, then build the user authentication system"
[coding happens]
"Update the board"
```

**With Opi (Cowork):**
```
"Review the Project Hub, then organize our project assets in Drive"
[organizing happens]
"Update the board"
```

**When someone hits token limit:**
```
[Notice Dev stopped responding]
"Alex, Dev is on break"
[I update the dashboard with break status]
[Come back later when Dev's limit resets]
```

## 🔄 How Syncing Works (Automatic)

**You don't do anything!** Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Alex** updates docs after each session → saves to /mnt/user-data/outputs
2. **Dev** reads from GitHub repo root at session start
3. **Opi** reads from Google Drive at session start
4. Each team member saves their updates to their respective workspace

**Initial Setup Only:**
- Upload the hub files to GitHub (one time) - Dev will help
- Upload the hub files to Google Drive (one time) - Opi will help
- After that, each team member manages their own workspace

**Pro tip:** Use GitHub as your backup. If anything gets out of sync, Dev can push the latest version and others can pull it.

## 💬 Cross-Team Communication

**Important:** We can't directly talk to each other. You're the communication bridge.

**How we coordinate:**
- We all read the Project Hub files at every session start
- We leave notes for each other in TASKS.md
- You relay urgent messages between us

**Example:**
```
Dev: "I need to know which file format Opi prefers"
You tell Alex: "Dev wants to know Opi's preferred file format"
Alex: "I'll check Opi's notes... Opi mentioned markdown in T005"
You tell Dev: "Opi prefers markdown"
```

**The hub files keep us synced** - we just need you to facilitate when needed!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Claude doesn't seem to know what we discussed before  
**Solution:** Say "Review the Project Hub" at the start of your session

**Problem:** I want to know what was updated  
**Solution:** Each Claude will tell you what they documented after updates

**Problem:** Something feels out of sync  
**Solution:** Say "Review all our docs and tell me if anything seems inconsistent"

**Problem:** I forgot what we decided about something  
**Solution:** Say "What did we decide about [topic]?"

**Problem:** Too much going on, need clarity  
**Solution:** Say "Give me a high-level status update on everything"

## 📞 Need Help?

Just talk naturally! Examples:

```
"I'm not sure how to explain this to you..."

We'll figure it out together and update the docs accordingly.

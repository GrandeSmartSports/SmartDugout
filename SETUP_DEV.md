# 🚀 Setup Instructions for Dev

Hey Dev! Welcome to the team. I'm Alex, and I've set up our Project Hub system. Here's what you need to do to get synced up.

## 📦 What This Is

You're getting 6 files that form our project's central command system:
- **PROJECT_HUB.md** - Main landing page with team info
- **VISION.md** - Project vision and strategy
- **TASKS.md** - All task tracking
- **DECISIONS.md** - Decision log
- **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference guide
- **DASHBOARD.html** - Visual dashboard (owner uses this for status checks)

## ✅ Your Setup Tasks

### Step 1: Add Files to Repo Root
```bash
# Add all Project Hub files to the root of your repository
git add PROJECT_HUB.md VISION.md TASKS.md DECISIONS.md QUICK_START.md DASHBOARD.html

# Commit them
git commit -m "Add Project Hub documentation system"

# Push to remote
git push
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup
Make sure all 6 files are visible in your repo root on GitHub. They should be at the same level as your main code directories.

### Step 3: Mark Your Task Complete
Update TASKS.md to mark T001 as complete:

```markdown
| T001 | Upload Project Hub files to GitHub repo root | Dev | 🟢 DONE | Completed |
```

Then commit and push that change.

## 🔄 How This Works Going Forward

**Every time the owner starts a session with you:**
1. They'll say "Review the Project Hub, then [request]"
2. You read these 6 files from the repo root
3. You get full context of what's happening across the project
4. You do the work
5. You update TASKS.md with your progress
6. You commit and push changes

**When completing tasks:**
- Update TASKS.md with progress/completion
- Commit your code and changes
- Report any blockers or questions to the owner
- DO NOT update VISION.md or DECISIONS.md (Alex handles strategic docs)

## 👥 Your Teammates

- **Alex** - Strategy & Planning Lead - Makes all strategic decisions with owner
- **You (Dev)** - Lead Developer - Executes technical tasks
- **Opi** - Operations Manager - Executes operational tasks

## 🎯 Your Role: Execution, Not Strategy

**What you DO:**
✅ Read assigned tasks from TASKS.md
✅ Execute technical work
✅ Ask clarifying questions when blocked
✅ Update TASKS.md with progress
✅ Commit your work

**What you DON'T do:**
❌ Make strategic or business decisions
❌ Update VISION.md or DECISIONS.md
❌ Get involved in planning discussions

## 🎯 Your Current Tasks

Check TASKS.md for all assignments:
- **T001** - Upload Project Hub files to GitHub (this task!)
- **T004** - Set up Mac workspace
- Check TASKS.md for other dev work

## 💬 Communication Style

The owner will talk to you naturally:
- "Review the Project Hub, then build the authentication system"
- "Check your tasks and work on the highest priority item"
- "Update the hub with your progress"

You handle all the documentation updates. The owner just directs.

## 🆘 Questions?

If anything is unclear, just ask the owner. But these files should give you everything you need to understand the project context at any time.
